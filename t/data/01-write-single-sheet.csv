# The format for this CSV is a follows:
#
# Comments start with the "#" character. That character should be the
# first character of the line 
#
# The first CSV line contains the name of the column
#
# The remaining lines contain the data. The fields should not have the
# " delimiters. The field cannot have the "," character in them
# because the CSV parser used by the tests doesn't escape the ","
# characters and assumes that they're always a field delimiter.
